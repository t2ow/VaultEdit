# VaultEdit

VaultEdit is a terminal-based text editor designed with a focus on simplicity, accessibility, and future-proof integration with AI technologies. Inspired by the best aspects of Vim, Emacs, and Nano, VaultEdit aims to create an intuitive editing experience while retaining power for advanced users. It is currently in its early stages of development, but the vision is to create a lightweight, feature-packed editor that will eventually integrate AI capabilities to assist with coding, debugging, and more—all without leaving the terminal.

## Vision

The vision behind VaultEdit is to build an editor that:

- **Combines the best features of Vim, Emacs, and Nano:**  
  The powerful command structure of Vim, the simplicity of Nano, and the extensibility of Emacs.

- **Offers an approachable interface for new users**  
  While still delivering advanced capabilities for developers.

- **Integrates AI-powered tools**  
  Assists users in writing, debugging, and generating code directly from the editor, creating an all-in-one solution for developers.

- **Is open-source and built with the community**  
  Allowing contributions, feedback, and constant evolution.

## Current State

VaultEdit is a work in progress. It is currently a basic terminal-based text editor with the following features:

- **Insert Mode**: Type freely to edit text.
- **Command Mode**: Perform operations like saving, quitting, and opening files.
- **Basic File Operations**: Save, open, and edit text files with a few simple commands.
- **Customization Options**: While minimal, customization of keybindings and editor behavior will be added in future updates.

## What’s Coming Next:

- **AI Mode**  
  Integration of local AI models like LLaMA or DeepSeek for users to leverage within the editor for debugging, code suggestions, and more. *(Planned for future releases.)*

- **More Advanced Features**  
  Features like advanced file handling, enhanced customization, and more intuitive workflows will be added as the project progresses.

## Development Timeline

I’m planning to release the first version in the next **4 months**. Until then, I have a lot to learn and a lot to build. The journey will be about becoming a modern tech developer in an age where AI is changing how we perceive coding.

## Personal Note

This project started out with a simple desire to **do something cool—because why not?**  
It’s a journey of creation, not driven by fame or profit, but by the excitement of building something from the ground up. Sometimes it’s just about making something interesting and useful, and that’s what VaultEdit is all about.  

Whether this project will ever be completed, I can’t say. But when I look back, I hope there’s a moment where I can think, **"That was some cool stuff."**
